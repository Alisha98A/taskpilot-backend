## Project Goals

TaskPilot is a personal productivity web application built with Django and React. The goal of the project is to help individuals take control of their daily routines, stay organized, and reduce mental clutter by providing a clear and easy-to-use system for managing tasks and notes.

### Primary Goals

- **Daily Task Management:** Allow users to create, view, edit, and delete tasks with deadlines and priority levels to stay on top of their responsibilities.
- **Personal Notes:** Enable users to jot down ideas, reminders, or to-dos in a simple note-taking interface related to a task.
- **Private Accounts:** Provide secure sign-up and login functionality, ensuring that each userâ€™s tasks and notes are stored privately.
- **Minimalist Design:** Deliver a clean and focused interface that minimizes distractions and supports a calm workflow.
- **Mobile-Friendly:** Ensure the application is accessible and easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Progress Tracking:** Help users monitor their productivity over time by reviewing completed tasks and personal notes.

### Long-Term Vision

- Add visual progress tracking (e.g., daily/weekly completion charts).
- Implement reminders and notifications for upcoming tasks.
- Enable tagging and color-coding for better organization.
- Introduce a calendar view for visual task planning.
- Add dark mode and customizable themes for a more personal experience.

## Testing

### Manual testing

### Automated testing

### Validator testing

---

## Deployment

---

### Initial Setup

- Sign up for a Heroku account at [heroku.com](https://www.heroku.com/).
- Download and install the Heroku CLI to interact with Heroku from your local machine.
- Alternatively, you can use the Heroku web interface for management tasks.

---

### Creating a Heroku App

1. Log into your Heroku account.
2. Click **New** > **Create new app**.
3. Enter a unique app name.
4. Choose your preferred region.
5. Click **Create app**.

---

### Preparing the Application

1. **Create a `Procfile`** in your projectâ€™s root directory.  
   For Django, the `Procfile` should contain:

```bash
release: python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate
web: gunicorn taskpilot_api.wsgi
```

This tells Heroku how to start your web server using Gunicorn.

2. Ensure your project has an up-to-date requirements.txt file listing all dependencies:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

3. Configure necessary environment variables in Heroku:
	â€¢	Go to your Heroku app dashboard.
	â€¢	Navigate to Settings > Config Vars.
	â€¢	Add variables such as SECRET_KEY, DATABASE_URL, and any others your project requires.

4.	Add your Heroku domain to the Django ALLOWED_HOSTS in settings.py:

```bash
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['your-heroku-app-name.herokuapp.com', 'localhost', '127.0.0.1']
```

---

### Configure Buildpacks

Heroku needs buildpacks to install dependencies not listed in `requirements.txt`:

1. Go to your appâ€™s **Settings** > **Buildpacks**.
2. Add **Python** buildpack first.
3. Add **Node.js** buildpack second.

> The order is important: Python first, then Node.js. You can reorder by dragging if necessary.

---

### Deployment Process

You can deploy your project in multiple ways:

- **Using GitHub integration:**
  - In your Heroku app dashboard, go to the **Deploy** tab.
  - Select **GitHub** as the deployment method.
  - Search for your repository `taskpilot-backend`.
  - Click **Connect**.
  - Scroll down to **Automatic Deploys** and click **Enable Automatic Deploys** to auto-deploy on every push, or
  - Click **Deploy Branch** to manually deploy.

- **Using Heroku CLI:**

  From your local project folder, run:

```bash
heroku login
heroku git:remote -a your-heroku-app-name
git push heroku main
```

### Running Migrations on Heroku

After deployment, run your Django migrations on the Heroku server:

```bash
heroku run python manage.py migrate
```


### Final Steps
  â€¢ Verify that the Web Dyno is running in the Heroku dashboard under the Resources tab.
  â€¢ Open your deployed application via the Heroku dashboard or run:

```bash
heroku open
```

### Local Deployment

### How to Clone

To work locally on your project:

1. Navigate to the GitHub repository **taskpilot-backend**.  
2. Click the **Code** dropdown.  
3. Select **HTTPS** and copy the URL.  
4. Open VSCode or your terminal.  
5. Navigate to the directory where you want your project.  
6. Run the command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alisha98A/taskpilot-backend.git
```

7. Your project is now cloned locally.

---

### Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python and pip installed. Then, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run Application Locally

Start your Django development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Visit http://localhost:8000 to see your app running locally.


### How to Fork a Repository

Forking lets you copy someone elseâ€™s project to your own GitHub account to make changes safely.
  1.  Log into GitHub.
  2.  Navigate to the repository you want to fork.
  3.  Click the Fork button in the top-right corner.
  4.  Optionally rename your fork and add a description.
  5.  Choose whether to fork just the main branch or all branches.
  6.  Click Create fork.
  7.  Your forked repository will appear in your GitHub account, ready for cloning and development.


This concludes the deployment and version control guide tailored to TaskPilot project using VSCode.

### Code

#### Code Origin and Adaptation

This project builds upon the foundation provided by **Code Institute's Walkthrough Projects**, which offer a valuable starting point for learning and structuring full-stack applications. Because of this, you may notice that some parts of the code â€” such as the overall architecture, certain components, or patterns â€” bear resemblance to those walkthrough examples.

#### Adaptation and Customization

However, I have not simply copied the code verbatim. Instead, I have thoroughly reviewed, adapted, and customized various sections to better suit the specific needs and goals of my project. This includes:

- **Modifying the user interface and styling** to match my design vision.
- **Adjusting business logic** to reflect unique features and requirements.
- **Adding or removing functionalities** to align with the project scope.
- **Refactoring code** for better readability, efficiency, and maintainability.

In summary, while the Code Institute's walkthrough projects provided essential guidance and structure, the final implementation is my own, tailored solution that reflects both learning and practical adaptation.

#### Use of React Bootstrap Components

I have used components from **React Bootstrap**, adapting them to fit the requirements of this project.

#### Dropdown in `TaskCreate.js` using React Bootstrap component

```jsx
<Dropdown.Toggle variant="success" id="dropdown-basic">
  Dropdown Button
</Dropdown.Toggle>

<Dropdown.Menu>
  <Dropdown.Item href="#/action-1">Action</Dropdown.Item>
  <Dropdown.Item href="#/action-2">Another action</Dropdown.Item>
  <Dropdown.Item href="#/action-3">Something else</Dropdown.Item>
</Dropdown.Menu>
```

#### Navbar component  `NavBar.js` using React Bootstrap component

[React Bootstrap Navbar Documentation](https://react-bootstrap-v4.netlify.app/components/navbar/)

```jsx
<Navbar.Brand href="#home">React-Bootstrap</Navbar.Brand>
<Navbar.Toggle aria-controls="basic-navbar-nav" />
<Navbar.Collapse id="basic-navbar-nav">
  <Nav.Link href="#home">Home</Nav.Link>
  <Nav.Link href="#link">Link</Nav.Link>
  <NavDropdown.Item href="#action/3.1">Action</NavDropdown.Item>
  <NavDropdown.Item href="#action/3.2">Another action</NavDropdown.Item>
  <NavDropdown.Item href="#action/3.3">Something</NavDropdown.Item>
  <NavDropdown.Divider />
  <NavDropdown.Item href="#action/3.4">Separated link</NavDropdown.Item>
  Search
</Navbar.Collapse>
```

#### Additional React Bootstrap Components

Beyond the examples shown above, this project incorporates several other components from **React Bootstrap** to build a consistent and responsive user interface. React Bootstrap offers a comprehensive library of pre-built components that integrate seamlessly with React, making development more efficient and maintaining a polished design easier.

You can explore the full range of components and documentation here:
