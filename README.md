- **Personal Notes:** Enable users to jot down ideas, reminders, or to-dos in a simple note-taking interface related to a task.
- **Private Accounts:** Provide secure sign-up and login functionality, ensuring that each user‚Äôs tasks and notes are stored privately.
- **Minimalist Design:** Deliver a clean and focused interface that minimizes distractions and supports a calm workflow.
- **Mobile-Friendly:** Ensure the application is accessible and easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Progress Tracking:** Help users monitor their productivity over time by reviewing completed tasks and personal notes.

### Long-Term Vision

- Add visual progress tracking (e.g., daily/weekly completion charts).
- Implement reminders and notifications for upcoming tasks.
- Enable tagging and color-coding for better organization.
