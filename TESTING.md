üêû Bug: Favicon and Static File Path Errors on Deployment

‚ùóÔ∏èProblem

After deployment, the application displayed 404 Not Found errors for the following favicon-related files:
	‚Ä¢	/favicon_io/logo.png
	‚Ä¢	/favicon_io/site.webmanifest

Additionally, there were issues with Django not properly collecting or serving some static files from the React build.

üîç Cause
	‚Ä¢	The favicon files were located in staticfiles/favicon_io/, but the React app expected them at /static/favicon_io/.
	‚Ä¢	collectstatic was not moving or recognizing some assets because of incorrect folder structure or STATICFILES_DIRS misconfiguration.

‚úÖ Solution
	1.	Moved Favicon Files
Moved the favicon assets into the React build path:
staticfiles/build/favicon_io/
	2.	Updated Django Settings
In settings.py, configured static settings to serve React and Django assets correctly:




STATIC_URL = '/static/'

STATICFILES_DIRS = [
    BASE_DIR / 'staticfiles' / 'build' / 'static',  # React static files
]

STATIC_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'staticfiles'
WHITENOISE_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'staticfiles' / 'build'

STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'whitenoise.storage.CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage'


	3.	Committed React Build
The built React files inside staticfiles/build/ were committed to Git to ensure they are available on Heroku during deployment.
	4.	Collected Static Files
Ran:

python manage.py collectstatic --noinput

This gathered Django admin static files and merged them with the React build in the staticfiles directory.
